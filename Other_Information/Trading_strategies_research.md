# Market making strategies / methods

 This file summarized my finding from Kaglle / Github / Book. This is probably not enough, but a good place to start with.

1. Use **volatility** to estmiate the price variation and manage risk
2. (Important) Check this [book](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/87351/53225588-MIT.pdf). This [code](https://github.com/mmargenot/machine-learning-market-maker) tried to implement one of its algorithm
3. (Might not be so useful): Stoikov's article on High Frequency Trading (**HFT**): [here](https://math.nyu.edu/~avellane/HighFrequencyTrading.pdf)
4. For processing / understanding **time-series data**with pandas: [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thebrownviking20/everything-you-can-do-with-a-time-series)
5. (Very important)Optiver's instruction on key market concepts: [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jiashenliu/introduction-to-financial-concepts-and-data/notebook). Some key concepts are **return**, **log return**, **realized volatility**
